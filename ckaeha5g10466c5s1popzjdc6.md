## Hello World

*Photo by Melissa Keizer on Unsplash*

You are welcome to my digital space on Hashnode. This is my first blog post here.

I have always wanted to do this, share knowledge and teach others what I know while documenting my journey but have not been able to, but thanks to Devblog I can now do that without much ado.

On this space, I would be writing on frontend technologies and other good stuff.
Most of what I will be writing on will be the problems I encountered on my journey and found solutions to plus new things I learn about.

Feel free to ask me questions around these topics.

See you soon.
