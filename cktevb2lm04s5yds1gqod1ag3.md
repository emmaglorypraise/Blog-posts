## Benefit of joining Communities as a student


I wrote a LinkedIn post about maximizing opportunities and communities as a university student, and I had multiple requests for more information about communities that students may join while on campus.

You can find that Linkedin post  [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emmaglorypraise_dear-nigerian-student-maximize-your-time-activity-6837010024003457024-5Zl8) 

Some of the advantages of being a part of a community are:

1. You can ask questions and receive assistance.
2. You can readily obtain mentorship or guidance.
3. You'll get informed about upcoming events, workshops, bootcamps, and career opportunities in your area.
4. You'll be able to establish a profitable network.
5. You get the opportunity to work on community projects.

There are so many advantages to being a part of the IT community that I can't list them all.


These are some of the communities I'm familiar with or have participated in in the past, there are a whole bunch of them out there. These communities are diverse in terms of fields, groups, and gender. Some are student-only communities, while others are general communities that anyone can be a part of.
